# Docker Policy Plugin: Enforce Supply-Chain Policies on Container Images

This Docker CLI plugin, powered by the Valint tool from Scribe Security, evaluates and enforces supply-chain policies on container images. It helps ensure that your containerized applications meet compliance standards and includes optional configuration for SBOM generation and debug logging.

## Install

Scribe install script will install scribe docker CLI scripts 

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scribe-security/misc/master/docker-cli-plugin/install.sh | sh
```


## Usage

Run the plugin from the Docker CLI with the policy subcommand, followed by Valint arguments:

```bash
docker policy <image> --rule sbom/fresh-sbom@v1 [options]
```

## Plugin Options

* `-d`, `--output-directory`: Specify a directory for output files (e.g., metadata).
* `-x`, `--debug`: Enable debug mode for verbose output.
* `--verify-only`: Run in verification-only mode, skipping additional checks.
* `--files`: Include a detailed SBOM analysis with component files.

## Policy Configuration

Policies can be managed as code. Policies and rules can be stored and managed by an organization's security team. 
By default, we provide a sample policy bundle with a subset of policies and rules. 

> You can review our default policies [here](https://github.com/scribe-public/sample-policies).

For more detailed information about policy management and rules, refer to the [Scribe Security documentation](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/guides/enforcing-sdlc-policy).

The plugin provides the capability to evaluate a set of rules from the command line or an entire policy file.

Hereâ€™s a rewritten version of your section on "Evidence Production":

## Evidence Production

By default, the plugin generates two pieces of evidence:

1. **SBOM Analysis**: A detailed Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) analysis of the container image.
2. **SARIF Result**: A SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) file that captures the policies evaluated and their results.

Both pieces of evidence can be signed with a variety of signers, providing integrity and traceability. [TBD Link] will provide more information on available signers.

These evidence files can be stored in multiple locations:
- **OCI-compliant registry**: Evidence can be stored in an OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant registry.
- **Locally**: Evidence can be saved to a local storage system for immediate use.
- **Scribe Service**: Evidence can also be uploaded and stored securely in our Scribe Service.

For high-value products, we recommend keeping track of the generated evidence to ensure future processes can verify or backtrack compliance. This helps maintain an audit trail and enhances the ability to demonstrate the integrity of the product throughout its lifecycle.

### Rule Option

The plugin provides access to a set of rules that can be combined with arguments:

```bash
docker policy ubuntu:latest --rule sbom/fresh-sbom@v1
```

### Policy Option

The plugin allows you to evaluate an entire policy through a file or remote access:

```bash
docker policy ubuntu:latest --policy image-policy@discovery
```

## Valint Options

Valint includes a wide range of options. For more details, refer to the [Valint documentation](https://scribe-security.netlify.app/docs/valint/).

### Example Commands TBD

**Basic Policy Evaluation:**

```bash
docker policy mongo-express:latest --rule sbom/fresh-sbom@v1
```

**Enabling Debug Mode and Output Directory:**

```bash
docker policy mongo-express:latest --rule sbom/fresh-sbom@v1 -x -d /path/to/output
```

**Verification Mode with SBOM Analysis:**

```bash
docker policy mongo-express:latest --rule sbom/fresh-sbom@v1 --verify-only --files
```

### Environment Variables

- `ONLY_VERIFY`: Run in verification-only mode (true by default).
- `INCLUDE_FILES`: Include file components in SBOM generation (false by default).
- `DEBUG_MODE`: Enable verbose output (false by default).
